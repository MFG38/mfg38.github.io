			<strong>3×3</strong> came to existence as a community project hosted by Yours Truly between and around Christmas of 2020 and the following New Year. Participating mappers were given a week to make up to 2 maps each under the following restrictions: only 3 flats, 3 textures and 3 enemy types were allowed to be used. A select few textures and flats, however, were excluded from the limitation, namely the DOOR***(2) textures and F_SKY1. By the deadline, the project ended up gathering 29 maps in total.<br><br>
			My own two contributions into the project on the mapping side occupy the MAP09 and MAP14 slots respectively. The former is “They Come At Knight”, a small valley/cave-style map with a foreboding start that has the player finding three keys before fighting a bunch of Hell Knights and Barons. And a Cyberdemon. The latter is “Hecks’d”, a single-room (pseudo-)slaughtermap made into an entirely hexagon-based layout.<br><br>
			Being the project lead on 3×3, I was in charge of essentially overseeing the whole thing and deciding which maps made the cut and which didn’t. Much to my own shock, I only ended up rejecting 2 submissions out of 29. Additionally, I compiled the “final” megawad, made the graphics and wrote the (E/Z)MAPINFO lumps.
