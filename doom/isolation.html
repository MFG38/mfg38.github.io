		<p><strong>Isolation</strong> was a community project hosted by Doom community legend Jimmy in March of 2020. The idea was to make a collection of speedmaps under a certain set of restrictions. The project ended up amassing enough maps for two full 32-level megawads, named <strong>Strain 1</strong> and <strong>Strain 2</strong>.</p>
		<p>My contribution to the Isolation project was MAP07 of Strain 2, “Cavern Abomination”. It is a small cave/techbase-styled map with straightforward gameplay. Progression in the map leans towards linear, with the player having to find a key in order to open a door that leads to the final combat area and, subsequently, the exit. The experience is accompanied by an original MIDI composition by Yours Truly.</p>
