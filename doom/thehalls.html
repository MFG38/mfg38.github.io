			<b>The Halls Speak to Me</b> is a 23-map megawad that came to life as a community project hosted by <b>DiR</b>. The
			gimmick in this one was to make maps referencing or inspired by Doom II MAP02, Underhalls. And uhh... 'nuff said,
			really.<br>
			<br>
			My contribution to the project, "an underhall i guess" (intended to be stylized in all lowercase), occupies the MAP04
			slot. The map opens up with a view that references Underhalls as closely as possible, but as you progress further into
			its concrete-walled depths, the map becomes more than that. The layout is somewhat inspired by Underhalls in how it
			loops around itself, but I took some liberties in other areas - perhaps most notably the outdoor section to the east.
			Gameplay in the map is relatively chill, and it's accompanied by a jazzy remix of "The Healer Stalks" that I composed
			myself.
