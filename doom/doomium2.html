            <b>Doomium II</b> is a 36-level Boom megawad that came to life as a community project hosted by <b>fai1025</b>. A
            sequel to the first Doomium, the focus of the project was on making maps with "frantic action". The maps are split
            into episodes of 5 levels each (plus a secret level), with each episode having its own distinct theme.<br>
            <br>
            My contribution, MAP06, opens the brutalism episode of Doomium II. It's a map named "Concrete Flow", and it takes
            place in a quasi-techbase with water running in the walls. Gameplay here leans towards hectic, with the player having
            to scramble a little for their ammo early on, and the map even contains an arena fight or two.<br>
            <br>
            This map admittedly isn't one of my personal favorites. From a gameplay perspective, it's one of my better ones,
            but not so much visually. I was going to spruce up the visuals in an update but ultimately never did. Oh well, at
            least it was fun to make.
