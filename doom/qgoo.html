			<strong>Quickly Getting One Off</strong> was a speedmapping community project hosted by <strong>Pezl</strong>. Consisting of 32 maps, each map for the project was
			made in an hour or less.<br>
			<br>
			My contribution towards the project, which occupies the MAP06 slot, was made in 25 minutes, which was the original time limit for the "challenge". The map is titled
			"Bad Trip", and it consists of what's essentially a single large room. At the center of said room is a centerpiece consisting of wiggly shapes and unevenly pulsing lights,
			creating a cool effect (if I do say so myself) that lends the map its name. As for the gameplay portion of the map, it comprises a single slaughter-esque fight against a
			few Hell Knights and Revenants. Nothing special, but I had fun making it.
