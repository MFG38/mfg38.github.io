            In this tutorial, I'll be covering the different <strong>map formats</strong> available for Doom, the differences
            between them and which one to pick for certain use cases.<br>
            <br>
            For a beginner just getting into Doom mapping, it can be understandably difficult to pick a map format due to the
            sheer amount available upon opening Doom Builder. I mean there's just so many different configurations, how could
            one possibly know which one to set up for their first map? But fret not, for I'm here to clarify the basic formats
            for you, as well as answer some questions about which source ports you should test each format in. I'll try to be as
            comprehensive as possible, so this might get a little long-winded. So go grab a beverage, sit back and let me take
            you through the rest of this tutorial/guide.<br>
            <br><br>

        <h3 id="doom">Doom format</h3>

        <p class="mainText">
            <strong>Doom format</strong>, also known as <strong>vanilla format</strong>, is the standard, non-extended map format
            that's used by the IWAD maps. Maps that aim for vanilla compatibility (i.e. compatibility with Chocolate Doom or the
            original DOS EXE) are generally made in this format. Limit-removing maps also generally fall under this format.<br>
            <br>
            Doom format is largely the only map format where the <b>static limits</b> of the Doom engine truly matter, in particular if
            vanilla compatibility is desired. Since it's essentially a non-extended map format, taking the static limits into account
            and staying within them is important when making vanilla-compatible maps. The static limits <i>can</i>, however, also be
            safely ignored if vanilla compatibility isn't needed - in this case, the map will become <strong>limit-removing</strong>.
            Naturally, a limit-removing map won't run in a strictly vanilla-compatible source port. Or maybe it will, until you run
            into a visplane overflow or some other thing that exceeds the static limits.<br>
            <br>
            As far as line actions and sector specials are concerned, in Doom format, they are limited to the ones hardcoded into the
            original Doom engine. Line actions or sector specials from the extended formats won't work in Doom-format maps, at least
            not in a source port that doesn't also support those formats. If Chocolate Doom detects a line action or sector special
            that's clearly an extended-format one in a map, it can even result in a crash. Or if it doesn't, that line action or sector
            special just won't work as intended unless you run the map in a source port that supports it. For limit-removing maps, though,
            Crispy Doom supports MBF sky transfers - see my <a href="mbf-sky-transfer.html">sky transfer tutorial</a> on how to use them.
            In strict vanilla, MBF sky transfers are not supported.<br>
            <br>
            Difficulty-wise, thing placement in Doom format is controlled by three flags: "Easy" for things that should appear on ITYTD and
            HNTR, "Medium" for HMP and "Hard" for UV and NM. Outside of difficulty flags, there's also the "Multiplayer" flag for things
            that should only appear on multiplayer game modes (cooperative and deathmatch). Note that vanilla Doom doesn't differentiate
            between coop and deathmatch for multiplayer-only things - from the engine's perspective, the two modes are one and the same in
            terms of thing placement.<br>
            <br>
            Use Doom format when you want to make a vanilla-compatible or limit-removing map. Doom format is also generally recommended for
            beginners just getting into mapping, as it's arguably the least overwhelming and most accessible format to work in.<br>

        <h3 id="boom">Boom format</h3>

        <p class="mainText">
            <strong>Boom format</strong> is arguably the oldest and most widely used extended map format, introduced by the Boom source port
            family, hence its name. It introduced a bunch of new mapping features that have become widely utilized by mappers of all skill levels,
            such as generalized line actions, translucency and scrolling floors, the latest of which is famously utilized in <b>voodoo doll
            scripting</b>.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps the most revolutionary feature added by Boom format, <b>generalized line actions</b>, essentially lets you define line actions not
            available in vanilla Doom or in the predefined new line actions added by Boom. By using a generalized line action, you can achieve more
            control than usual over things such as how long a lift waits before going back up, the speed of a door etc. A generalized line action can
            usually be identified by being a 4-or-5-number sequence as opposed to the 1-3-number sequences used by predefined line actions, and by using
            a generalized line action, you can control every aspect of the assigned action individually. If there's something very specific you want to
            do and you can't find it in the list of predefined line actions, there's a very high chance you can do it with a generalized one.<br>
            <br>
            Another quite popular feature supported by Boom is the <b>MBF sky transfer</b>, which allows the mapper to define an arbitrary sky texture
            (or several!) for a given map instead of having to settle for the one hardcoded into the map slot. This feature becomes very useful in megawads
            that have a non-standard "episode" structure, such as Eviternity with its 6 distinctly themed chapters that consist of 5 maps each. Having the
            same sky stuck across 2 chapters' worth of maps would only mess with that theming, right?<br>
            <br>
            In addition, multiplayer-specific thing placement in Boom format can be split between coop and deathmatch. In UDB, the respective flags are called
            "Not Deathmatch" and "Not Cooperative", and, as the names imply, they will prevent the thing with one of said flags from spawning in one of those
            modes. Difficulty-wise, Boom handles thing placement the same way as Doom format: "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" flags for ITYTD/HNTR, HMP and UV/NM
            respectively.<br>
            <br>
            Boom format is best used for maps where the widest compatibility range is desired, as most advanced source ports support the Boom feature set. The
            obvious caveat is that you won't be able to play a Boom-format map in a more vanilla-strict source port like Chocolate Doom.<br>

        <h3 id="hexen">Hexen format</h3>

        <p class="mainText">
            <strong>Hexen format</strong>, as its name implies, was first introduced by the game Hexen. Perhaps most famously, it brought with it ACS (short
            for Action Code Script), a scripting language that allows the scripting of elaborate sequences and map-specific logic. ACS support for Doom maps
            was first implemented by ZDoom, and the same source port also greatly extended the language's functionality later down the line.<br>
            <br>
            Because Hexen was structured less like Doom and more like an RPG, its eponymous map format also came with a series of features to support non-linear
            progression structuring. Players could now travel more or less seamlessly between multiple maps contained within a "hub", often with a single map
            containing multiple exits to different maps instead of a single exit that would take them to the next map. Other features brought by the Hexen
            format include class-specific thing placement, "dormancy" for things and polyobjects.<br>
            <br>
            Hexen format is one of the less supported map formats, with ZDoom and its derivatives being among the only source ports to have implemented full
            support for it. However, ACS is at least partially supported by Eternity Engine. Yet, in its early days, Hexen format ended up being widely used for wads
            that targeted the ZDoom source port family specifically. That said, Hexen format is little more than a technical curiosity at this point - with the
            advent of UDMF, which supports all features of the Hexen format and a bunch more, it makes more sense to use that over Hexen format unless you're making
            a map for vanilla Hexen.<br>
            <br>
            <b>When to map in Hexen format?</b> If you're curious about it. UDMF is more advanced and thusly the better option, though.<br>
            <b>Which port to test in?</b> (G)ZDoom<br>
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3 id="udmf">UDMF format</h3>

        <p class="mainText">
            <strong>UDMF format</strong> is one of the newest map formats to appear. It expands greatly upon the feature set provided by Hexen format and provides
            very fine-grained control over almost any property imaginable. Only in UDMF is it possible to do independent brightness values on lines, sector reflection
            without ACS, independent texture scaling and rotation and a bunch of other things that'd make this single paragraph way too long if I listed them all off.<br>
            <br>
            The fundamental difference between UDMF and other map formats is that UDMF stores the map data into a single lump called TEXTMAP, whereas other formats store
            different map data, such as sector, thing and linedef data, into their own lumps. Nodes and compiled ACS code, however, are still stored into their own lumps.<br>
            <br>
            Support for the UDMF format is chiefly limited to the most advanced source ports, namely the ZDoom family and Eternity Engine. Due to the different design
            philosophies between the two, a UDMF map made for GZDoom will most likely not work in Eternity and vice versa. This is because UDMF implements namespaces to
            translate the line actions and whatnot for a specific source port.<br>
            <br>
            Because UDMF is an advanced format, it's generally not recommended for beginners, as the sheer number of options available can get overwhelming. It's a good
            idea to start with one of the less advanced formats and only give UDMF a spin when you're comfortable in your map editor of choice.<br>
            <br>
            <b>When to map in UDMF format?</b> When you know your way around the editor and want to make something advanced.<br>
            <b>Which port to test in?</b> GZDoom / Eternity (depending on target port)<br>
            <br><br>
            That concludes this map format guide.
