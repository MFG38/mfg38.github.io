Description             : This is a mini-mod for GZDoom that essentially
                          makes the weapons more situational while keeping
                          the rest of the vanilla gameplay intact.

* Details *

Interested in the details of how each weapon (except the BFG) has been modified?
Then read on!

Fist:
The fist now deals 6-10 damage (60-100 with Berserk), and punching the oxygen
does not alert monsters. However, hurting an unaware monster with the fist will
alert other monsters within a 256-unit radius. 

Chainsaw:
Each chainsaw hit now deals 4-20 damage (4 * random(1,5)).

Pistol:
The pistol now deals 8-13 damage and has a range of 1600 map units. It has the
longest range out of the hitscan weapons.

Shotgun:
The shotgun now fires 8 "pellets", each of which deal 11-14 damage. It has a range
of 448 map units.

SSG:
The SSG now fires 16 "pellets", each of which deal 12-15 damage. It has a slightly
shorter range than the shotgun at 384 map units.

Chaingun:
The chaingun now deals 8-12 damage and has a range of 1280 map units. Also, it
fires 1 bullet in a cycle instead of 2.

Rocket launcher:
Rockets fired by the rocket launcher now have a base damage of 25-150
(25 * random(1,6)), and their explosions deal an additional 100 damage at a radius
of 96 map units.

Plasma gun:
The plasma gun's projectiles now deal 10-40 damage (5 * random(2,8)), and their
speed has been slightly increased. The "cooldown" time after the player finishes
firing the plasma gun has also been slightly increased.


* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch

                          else)

Known Bugs              : None that I know of.
