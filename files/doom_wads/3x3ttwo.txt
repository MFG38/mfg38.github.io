Title                   : 3x3: Take Two
Filename                : 3x3ttwo.wad

Description             : 3x3: Take Two is the spiritual sequel to the 3x3
                          community project, hosted by MFG38. The set
                          contains 30 maps from 22 different authors, using
                          only 3 flats, 3 wall textures and 3 enemy types per
                          map. Maps were sorted *roughly* by difficulty this
                          time around to make the final mapset more friendly
                          for continuous play.

Additional Credits to   : Participating mappers, authors of music tracks used
                          (see "Music list"), authors of custom textures used
