A Piece of Hell

A small Doom 2 wad of 5 maps made by members of the Piece of Pie Software
community, a ZDoom map pack made in Hexen format. Howevever it's strongly
advised you play using the latest version of the GZDoom source port as that's
what it was tested with by all those who participated in this project.

How to play:
Drag the APieceOfHell.pk3 to your gzdoom.exe shortcut and select Doom 2 as
the IWAD and that's it, enjoy.
