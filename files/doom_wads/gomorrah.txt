Description             : Gomorrah is a mapset for GZDoom consisting of 6
                          brand-new maps, powered by ukiro's amazing OTEX
                          texture set. In Gomorrah, you'll be traversing
                          three different locations - an abandoned
                          mine/techbase, a medieval castle and a fortress in
                          Hell - in search of three skull keys. Each skull
                          key is going to be locked behind a puzzle which
                          you'll have to solve. Once you have all three of
                          them, you must use them to open a gate beyond which
                          lies your final challenge.
                          
                          IMPORTANT NOTES:
                          - Jumping and crouching are disabled.
                          - Playing with freelook is recommended, as puzzle
                            hints are hidden in the environment, though not
                            always at eye level.
                          - Lighting mode is forced to Standard.
			  - Loading lights.pk3 or any mod that adds custom
			    dynamic lights is not advised, as Gomorrah comes
			    with its own dynamic light definitions and the
			    final battle will most likely drop your framerate
			    down to unplayable levels if lights.pk3 is loaded.
			  - Normal is the standard difficulty you should play
			    on. As the difficulties don't affect thing
			    placements, the differences between them are
			    chiefly in the amount of damage dealt by enemies.
			    Hard+ is essentially a challenge mode.
