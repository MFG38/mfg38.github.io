Description             : Literalism is a 26-level Boom-compatible mapset
                          that came to life as a community project hosted by
                          MFG38. In a similar fashion to how speedmapping
                          sessions often provide a theme and/or restriction
                          to work with, participating mappers were given a
                          randomly generated map title to make their maps.
