Description             : Charcoal is a 21-level limit-removing megawad made
                          during the NaNoWADMo event in 2021. The set is
                          divided into 4 "chapters", each with their own
                          theme, and has a loose narrative about our
                          protagonist traversing through the locales,
                          ultimately entering an odd-looking dimension and
                          destroying a machine. Each map for Charcoal was
                          made as a speedmap in 75 minutes or less.
