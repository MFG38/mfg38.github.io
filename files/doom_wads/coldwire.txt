Description             : A UAC material shipment has gone haywire. Something
                          alien and deadly snuck into a shipping container
                          and caused the most brutal traffic accident mankind
                          has ever seen. Civilian casualties range in the
                          thousands. You, a private detective, read about it
                          in the news and decide to go see what the fuss is
                          about. As you arrive at the scene of the "crime",
                          you can't help but think that despite the corpses
                          everywhere - some clearly inhuman - the atmosphere
                          is oddly serene...

                          ColdWire is a limit-removing mapset that aims to combine
                          modern visuals with classically inspired gameplay. Boasting
                          a bespoke custom palette and a tailor-made texture set,
                          the maps in ColdWire aim to create a strong and inviting
                          atmosphere while keeping the player on their toes with
                          IWAD-esque but nonetheless thrilling combat. The player
                          is going to traverse through roughly an episode's worth of
                          techbases and urban environments in search for answers to
                          a traffic accident of historical magnitude.

                          Three guest maps are provided by Salmon and Death Bear.
                          ColdWire also features a full original soundtrack composed
                          entirely by MFG38 himself.

                          cwwidegfx.wad contains widescreen versions of some of the
                          graphics.
