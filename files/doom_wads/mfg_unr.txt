Description             : A collection of two previously unreleased maps
                          created by me back in 2009. One of them is a
                          collaboration effort with a friend and the other,
                          with some modifications, became a map in another
                          wad of mine.

Additional Credits to   : id Software for Doom and MrVonsta for
