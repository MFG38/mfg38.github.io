Title                   : 3x3
Filename                : 3x3.wad
Author                  : Various

Description             : 3x3 is a 29-level megawad that came to life as a
                          community project hosted by MFG38. Participating
                          mappers were given a week to make up to 2 maps each
                          while only allowed to use 3 flats, 3 textures and 3
                          enemy types. (A select few textures/flats were
                          excluded from the limit.) The maps were compiled
                          into this megawad in order of submission, barring a
                          few exceptions, so the difficulty curve may be a
                          little all over the place.

Additional Credits to   : All participating mappers, authors of music tracks
                          used (see "Music list") and authors of custom sky
                          textures used.
