Description             : Welcome to McDoomguy's! What can I get you?
                          You're not sure? Well then, might I interest you
                          in our Slaughterific Sample Platter? It's our
                          award-winning 42-course meal crafted by a
                          selection of chefs, world-famous veterans and
                          new tryouts alike. Whatever it is you're craving
                          today, you're bound to find something to satisfy
                          your hunger in there. And somehow it doesn't cost
                          anything! Seriously, why didn't we put a price tag
                          on the thing? It's literally our most famous
                          dish and it's slowly bankrupting us...

                          Oh right, you probably wanna know what the entire
                          gimmick here was. Well, the participating chefs
                          had a selection of 12 different design restrictions
                          on offer, of which they had to use at least 3.
                          At least two out of the following:
                          - 100 lines or less
                          - 10 sectors or less
                          - 3 textures and 3 flats
                          - 1024x1024 or smaller map size
                          - No orthogonal lines
                          - Only 1 monster type
                          - Grid size of 64

                          And one out of these:
                          - Pacifist map
                          - Monsterless puzzle/platforming map
                          - Hitscan enemies only
                          - A bunch of explosive barrels
                          - Sector special 10
