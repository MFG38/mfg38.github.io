Description             : MFG38 proudly presents I Wanna Be The Hell
                          Veteran, a new hardcore-style wad. Five new,
                          relentless levels and hundreds of demons await
                          you. Do you have what it takes to get the Hell
                          Veteran medal? Grab your shotgun, marine - it's
                          time to kick demon ass once again.

Additional Credits to   : MrVonsta and Cooler3737 for supporting me
                          throughout the creation process, Randy Heit and
                          Graf Zahl for ZDoom, and id Software for the
                          obvious reason. Also, thanks to this project
                          itself for being an obsession, and to Doom for
                          making me fall in love with it.

Known Bugs              : The cyberdemon in the red key area in MAP03 seems to
			  be stuck in its sector, not attacking the player
			  even when shot, especially on any difficulty level
			  other than NM. Stretching the sector a bit might help
			  to resolve the issue, but I'm too lazy to fix it. :P
