Description             : Devious Deviance came to life as a community
                          project hosted by MFG38 of 3x3 and Literalism
                          fame. In this project, the gimmick revolved around
                          implementing difficulty settings in somewhat of a
                          non-traditional fashion; the monsters you'll
                          encounter are the exact same across each difficulty
                          setting. What changes instead is everything else,
                          be it the armaments you're given, the layout of an
                          arena or even the route you take through a map!

                          Included in this mapset are 8 maps (plus a credits
                          map) by 8 authors, making use of the ever-versatile
                          OTEX texture pack and providing varying gameplay
                          styles along with different (sometimes insanely
                          creative!) ways in which the difficulty settings
                          alter the experience.
