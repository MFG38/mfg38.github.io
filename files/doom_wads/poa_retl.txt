Description             : Prayers of Armageddon: Retaliation is a complete
                          recreation of the 2010 hit classic (read:
                          horrible POS) Prayers of Armageddon. The forces
                          of Hell have once again been unleashed. You know
                          the drill - grab the shotgun and go kick ass.
