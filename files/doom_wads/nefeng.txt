Description             : Nefarious Engine was mainly an attempt at creating
                          a map with exactly 666 lines. (And the map actually
                          does have exactly 666 lines!) In Nefarious Engine,
                          the only boomstick you're granted is a rocket
                          launcher, with a berserk pack as a backup of sorts.
                          Also, the exit is guarded by a cyberdemon, but a
                          conveniently placed crusher might take him down if
                          you can find the switch to activate it...
