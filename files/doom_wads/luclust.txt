Description             : Luciferian Lust is a loosely Hell-themed 2-hour
                          speedmap made in Valentine's Day of 2020. The map
                          includes 42 demons to kill - the catch is that you
                          have to manage it with no health or armor given to
                          you other than a soulsphere and a green armor, as
                          well as a few (and I *do* mean few) health and
                          armor bonuses scattered across the map.
