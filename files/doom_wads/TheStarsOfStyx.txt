Description             : There are legends about a place in Hell, across
                          River Styx, where a cloud of stars can be gazed
                          upon against a deep blue sky. This place is a
                          very special one, as it is told that the Stars of
                          Styx can resurrect a soul into life. No man has
                          ever traversed into this place, and those who
                          tried, they were stopped by the minions of Satan.
                          But is it worth the task after all?
