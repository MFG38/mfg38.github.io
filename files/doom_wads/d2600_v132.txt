Description             : Deliverance 2600 is a Metroidvania-inspired,
                          exploration-focused total conversion for Doom,
                          powered by the GZDoom engine. The player assumes
			  the role of Stanford T. Pace, a former prison
			  inmate who volunteers for Project Deliverance,
			  which is intended to rehabilitate criminals by
			  means of extreme discipline. He is then sent out
			  on a mission to investigate a mysterious
			  communications breakdown with a research facility
			  on the planet Ferrus XII. But what he seeks is
			  something else than redemption...

Known Bugs              : During the battle sequences after picking up a
			  keycard, the enemies can be prevented from spawning
			  if you stand "on" their spawning spot when they
			  should spawn, thus breaking the scripts that are
			  supposed to re-open the path once they're all
			  killed. Unfortunately, there appears to be no
			  simple fix for this - just don't stand where they
			  should spawn.
May Not Run With        : other ports than GZDoom (or at least
                          non-ZDoom-based ones)
Tested With             : GZDoom 1.8.1-597-gcd6d653, 3.1.0, 3.3.2 & 3.7.2
