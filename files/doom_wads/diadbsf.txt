Description             : "Death is a Dish Best Served Fast" is a small
                          proof-of-concept(ish) map based upon an
                          unconventional idea for implementing difficulty
                          settings. The monster count and composition is the
                          same across all difficulties - it's the weapons
                          provided and their locations that change with them.
                          The layout for the map was speedmapped in 30
                          minutes, with the rest of the development work
                          being done outside that timeframe.
