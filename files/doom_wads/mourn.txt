Description             : Mourn is a Boom-compatible slaughtermap powered by
                          the ever-so-impressive OTEX. The map takes place in
                          something resembling a volcanic mountain area with
                          a few abstract tech-like structures built into it.
                          Who put them there? What purpose do they serve?
                          Nobody knows.
                          
                          This map was my first attempt at building a serious
                          slaughtermap at a large, non-speedmap scale. While
                          slaughter gameplay was largely the intention, the
                          combat encounters still offer some variety, with a
                          couple more gimmicky fights to spice things up a
                          little. It may not be continuous streams of
                          enemies, but this is still one of the harder maps
                          I've made, if not the hardest so far. Designing the
                          fights for this map was a lot of fun and definitely
                          a learning experience in more ways than one. The
                          experience is accompanied by a 10-minute
                          prog-inspired MIDI epic of the same name, composed
                          by none other than Yours Truly.
