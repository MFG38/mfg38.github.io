Description             : TRAKtion is a small, arcade-style map in which the
                          objective is to make it to the exit as fast as
                          possible. You hit a switch at the start of the
                          level to start your run, and once you do, you'd
                          better run as though the devil himself is chasing
                          you down. The only two weapons at your disposal are
                          your fist and infighting. A new enemy wave spawns
                          every 45 seconds. Good luck - you're going to need
                          it.
                          
                          NOTE: This map is intended to be played in a single
                          sitting with no saves. Please refrain from
