Description             : Welcome to a new relentless circle of Hell
                          spawned from H3llraich's sick mind. In this
                          realm of chaos, even the most hardened veterans
                          struggle to make their way through. Have fun.

Additional Credits to   : MrVonsta and cooler3737 for the support, and,
                          most obviously, id Software for Doom and Doom
                          itself. My love for this game is eternal.
