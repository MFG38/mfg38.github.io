Description             : Another Damn E1M1 Remake was an effort to see if
                          I could create a map within the limits of the
                          vanilla Doom engine, which I apparently
                          accomplished. The map is fairly small, but it's
                          not exactly a speedmap, although you could
                          probably think of it as one.

May Not Run With...     : The map was tested in Chocolate Doom as it was
                          constructed to ensure full vanilla compatibility,
                          so it should run even in vanilla Doom.
