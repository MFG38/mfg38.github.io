			Hello there. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.<br>
			<br>
			Allow me to introduce myself (and this site). I am <strong>Santtu Pesonen</strong>, also known as <strong>MFG38</strong> around some parts
			of the Internet. I was born in 1994, I live in Finland, and I like video games, music, coffee, beer, sushi, scifi, technology and cute
			things. I also make some of the aforementioned things on occasion, namely music, games and game mods.<br>
			<br>
			So, what you've stumbled upon here is my personal little corner of the Internet for showcasing some of the work I've done. We have DOOM
			wads, we have video games, we have mapping tutorials. Go ahead and take a look around.
